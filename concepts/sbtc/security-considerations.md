# Security Considerations

This document outlines key security considerations for the sBTC system.

## Peg Wallet Security

- The sBTC peg wallet is secured by a multi-signature scheme requiring a threshold of signers
- Private keys for signers must be stored securely, ideally in hardware security modules
- Regular security audits of signer infrastructure should be conducted

## Signer Set

- The initial signer set is determined by community vote to ensure decentralization
- A minimum of 5 signers is recommended for adequate security and fault tolerance
- Signer set should be geographically distributed to mitigate risks

## Key Rotation

- Signers can rotate their private keys to mitigate risks of key compromise
- Key rotation process must be carefully coordinated to maintain peg wallet security

## Smart Contract Security

- All sBTC-related Clarity contracts should undergo thorough security audits
- Formal verification of critical contract components is recommended
- Upgrade mechanisms should be carefully designed and controlled

## Transaction Validation

- Rigorous validation of deposit and withdrawal transactions on both Bitcoin and Stacks chains
- Implement safeguards against double-spend attacks and transaction malleability

## Operational Security

- Strict access controls and monitoring for all sBTC infrastructure
- Regular security training for all personnel involved in sBTC operations
- Incident response plans should be established and regularly tested

## User Security

- Clear guidelines for users on securely storing and transacting with sBTC
- Education on potential risks and best practices

## Ongoing Security

- Regular security assessments and penetration testing of the entire sBTC system
- Bug bounty program to incentivize responsible disclosure of vulnerabilities
- Continuous monitoring for unusual activity or potential exploits

By adhering to these security considerations, the sBTC system aims to provide a robust and secure bridge between Bitcoin and the Stacks ecosystem. However, security is an ongoing process and these measures should be regularly reviewed and updated.
