# Internal Representations

This section covers the internal representations of BTC used in the sBTC system:

1. [Peg Wallet UTxO](peg-wallet-utxo.md): How the Bitcoin peg is maintained
2. [Clarity Contracts](clarity-contracts.md): Smart contracts that manage sBTC on the Stacks blockchain

These internal representations form the backbone of the sBTC system, enabling secure and efficient operations between the Bitcoin and Stacks blockchains.
