# Using sBTC in DeFi Applications

This guide explains how users can utilize their sBTC in various Decentralized Finance (DeFi) applications on the Stacks blockchain.

## Overview

sBTC allows Bitcoin holders to participate in DeFi applications on the Stacks blockchain without selling their BTC. This opens up opportunities for earning yield, providing liquidity, and engaging in other financial activities.

## Common DeFi Use Cases for sBTC

1. **Lending and Borrowing**

   - Lend your sBTC to earn interest
   - Use sBTC as collateral to borrow other assets

2. **Liquidity Provision**

   - Provide liquidity to sBTC trading pairs in decentralized exchanges
   - Earn fees from trades in these pools

3. **Yield Farming**

   - Stake your sBTC or sBTC liquidity pool tokens in yield farming protocols
   - Earn additional tokens or fees as rewards

4. **Synthetic Assets**
   - Use sBTC as collateral to mint synthetic assets representing other cryptocurrencies or real-world assets

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Choose a DeFi Application**

   - Research and select a Stacks-based DeFi application that supports sBTC

2. **Connect Your Wallet**

   - Connect your Stacks wallet containing sBTC to the DeFi application

3. **Select the Desired Action**

   - Choose the DeFi activity you want to engage in (e.g., lending, providing liquidity)

4. **Approve sBTC Usage**

   - Grant permission for the DeFi application to use your sBTC

5. **Confirm the Transaction**

   - Review and confirm the transaction details
   - Submit the transaction to the Stacks blockchain

6. **Monitor Your Position**
   - Keep track of your sBTC position in the DeFi application
   - Be aware of any risks or potential liquidation scenarios

## Important Considerations

- Always research and understand the risks associated with any DeFi application before using it
- Be aware of smart contract risks and the possibility of bugs or exploits
- Understand the terms and conditions of each DeFi protocol, including fees and reward structures
- Keep track of your transactions for tax reporting purposes

## Direct BTC to DeFi Integration

Some DeFi applications may offer direct integration with the sBTC bridge, allowing you to deposit BTC and immediately use it in the DeFi application. This process typically involves:

1. Selecting the option to deposit BTC directly into the DeFi application
2. Sending BTC to the provided address
3. The application automatically converts BTC to sBTC and uses it in the selected DeFi activity

This streamlined process can make it even easier for Bitcoin holders to participate in Stacks-based DeFi.
