# Withdrawing sBTC to BTC

This guide explains the process of converting sBTC back to BTC, allowing users to move their assets from the Stacks ecosystem back to the Bitcoin blockchain.

## Process Overview

1. User initiates a withdrawal through the sBTC bridge dashboard or a compatible wallet.
2. The withdrawal request is processed on the Stacks blockchain.
3. After confirmation (6 Stacks block sortitions), the sBTC Bootstrap Signers process the withdrawal.
4. BTC is sent to the user's specified Bitcoin address.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Access the sBTC Bridge**

   - Navigate to the sBTC bridge dashboard or use a compatible wallet.

2. **Initiate Withdrawal**

   - Select the "Withdraw sBTC" or "Redeem sBTC" option.
   - Specify the amount of sBTC you want to convert back to BTC.
   - Enter the Bitcoin address where you want to receive your BTC.

3. **Confirm the Transaction**

   - Review the details of your withdrawal request.
   - Confirm the transaction, which will be submitted to the Stacks blockchain.

4. **Wait for Confirmation**

   - The system will wait for 6 Stacks block sortitions (confirmations) to ensure the finality of the transaction.
   - This process typically takes about 60-90 minutes.

5. **Receive BTC**
   - Once confirmed and processed by the sBTC Bootstrap Signers, the equivalent amount of BTC will be sent to your specified Bitcoin address.

## Important Considerations

- Ensure you're using the official sBTC bridge or a trusted, compatible wallet.
- Double-check the Bitcoin address you're withdrawing to. Errors cannot be reversed.
- Be aware of any minimum withdrawal amounts or fees associated with the process.
- The conversion rate is always 1:1 (1 sBTC = 1 BTC).

## Troubleshooting

- If your withdrawal doesn't appear after several hours, check the transaction status on both Stacks and Bitcoin block explorers.
- For any issues, contact the sBTC support team through official channels.
