# Future Development

This document outlines the roadmap for future development of sBTC beyond the initial v1 release.

## sBTC v2

The next major version of sBTC is planned for late 2024 and will introduce several key improvements:

1. **Decentralized Signer Set**: Transition from the bootstrap signer set to a more decentralized model where Stacks miners also act as sBTC signers.

2. **Native Stacks Integration**: sBTC operations will be handled natively by Stacks nodes, removing the need for separate signer infrastructure.

3. **Economic Incentives**: Introduce rewards for signers/miners to incentivize faithful processing of sBTC operations.

4. **Improved Scalability**: Optimize the system to handle higher transaction volumes and reduce confirmation times.

## Potential Future Enhancements

1. **Cross-chain Interoperability**: Explore bridging sBTC to other blockchain ecosystems.

2. **Advanced DeFi Integrations**: Develop more sophisticated DeFi primitives leveraging sBTC.

3. **Layer 2 Solutions**: Investigate Layer 2 scaling solutions for faster and cheaper sBTC transactions.

4. **Privacy Enhancements**: Research and potentially implement privacy-preserving features for sBTC transactions.

5. **Governance Improvements**: Refine the governance model for protocol upgrades and parameter adjustments.

## Community Involvement

The future development of sBTC will heavily rely on community input and contributions. Developers, researchers, and users are encouraged to participate in:

- Proposing and discussing improvement proposals
- Contributing to the codebase
- Participating in testnets and security audits
- Providing feedback on user experience and feature requests

Stay tuned to the official sBTC communication channels for updates on the development roadmap and opportunities to contribute to the future of Bitcoin on Stacks.
